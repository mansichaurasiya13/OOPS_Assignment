        "#Answer: Elaborate on the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\n",
        "\n",
        "#1. Encapsulation: This concept involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, called a class or object. Encapsulation hides the implementation details of an object from the outside world, making it harder for other parts of the program to access or modify its internal state directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2. Abstraction: Abstraction is the practice of showing only the necessary information to the outside world while hiding the internal details. In OOP, abstraction allows you to focus on essential features of an object while ignoring non-essential details. This helps reduce complexity and improve code modularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#3. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class to inherit properties and behavior from another class. The child class inherits all the attributes and methods of the parent class and can also add new attributes and methods or override the ones inherited from the parent class. Inheritance promotes code reuse and facilitates the creation of a hierarchy of related classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. This can be achieved through method overriding (where a subclass provides a different implementation of a method already defined in its superclass) or method overloading (where multiple methods with the same name can be defined with different parameter lists). Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "#5. Composition: Composition is a concept that represents a whole-part relationship between objects. An object can be composed of one or more other objects, which are called its components. Composition allows for the creation of complex objects from simpler ones, enabling a more modular and flexible program design.\n",
        "\n",
